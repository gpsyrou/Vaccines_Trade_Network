    "### Project Puprose\n",
    "Scope of this project is to construct the global trade network of vaccines around the globe for multiple years(current data span from 2017 to 2019. Through plotting and statistical analysis, we want to identify informative patterns on how different countries change their import/export activity of vaccines. \n",

    "### Data Retrieval\n",
    "In order to find and retrieve data we have utilised the UN Comtrade API (https://comtrade.un.org/Data/).This is a great place if someone wants to find data regarding exports/impors of countries around the world, pretty much for any product/service. The data are very well documented and visualized on the website, and it's easy to do some exploration  and locate data that seem interesting for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after I managed to identify the relevant data that I wanted to work with (vaccines for human medicine), I had to find a way to leverage the API to get my data. Even though the website allows us to download sample CSV files, if we wanted to do that for multiple years and countries it would take a lot of time. Hence, I have decided to approach the data retrival from a Python standpoint, in order to automate this task.\n",

    "Before we jump to the part of how we are going to automate the data retrieval, it might worths it to explain what exactly we are aiming to retrieve.\n",

    "The UN Comtrade database is giving us the opportunity to pick from a plethora of goods and services. My first task was to find the specific code that corresponds to human vaccines. After a bit of research we have found that this code is *300220*, which is a unique value that will allow us to only pick data for this good/product. After we located our product code, we have to decide on the time range that we want to pick data for. This can quickly get tricky as the database does not allow you to many years/countries all at once. But for now lets say that the scope of interest was 2017 to 2019, for as many countries as possible - mainly because there are countries which do not seem to import/export vaccines or we do not have relevant information about them.\n"
