    "### Project Puprose\n",
    "Scope of this project is to construct the global trade network of vaccines around the globe for multiple years(current data span from 2017 to 2019. Through plotting and statistical analysis, we want to identify informative patterns on how different countries change their import/export activity of vaccines. \n",

    "### Data Retrieval\n",
    "In order to find and retrieve data we have utilised the UN Comtrade API (https://comtrade.un.org/Data/).This is a great place if someone wants to find data regarding exports/impors pretty much on any product/service. The data are very well documented and visualized on the website, and it's easy to do some exploration  and locate data that seem interesting for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after I managed to identify the relevant data that I wanted to work with (vaccines for human medicine), I had to find a way to leverage the API to get my data. Even though the website allows us to download sample CSV files, if we wanted to do that for multiple years and countries it would take a lot of time. Hence, I have decided to approach the data retrival from a Python standpoint, in order to automate this task."
